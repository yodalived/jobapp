Hi! I'm continuing development work on a **resume automation system**. This is a fully functional Python application that I need your help to continue developing.

## System Overview

**What it is**: Multi-tenant SaaS platform for AI-powered resume generation and job application tracking  
**Tech Stack**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Kafka + Next.js 15 + TypeScript  
**Current Status**: âœ… Phase 1 Complete (100% - 34/34 features done)  
**Architecture**: Event-driven cell architecture designed to scale from 100 to 30,000+ users  

## Current Functionality

âœ… **Working Features**:
- FastAPI backend with JWT authentication and multi-tenant architecture
- PostgreSQL database with proper user isolation  
- AI-powered resume customization using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
- LaTeX-based PDF resume generation with professional templates
- Job description analysis and resume optimization
- **Modern Frontend UI**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Responsive landing page, authentication forms, and dashboard
- **Email Verification**: Complete flow with SMTP integration and HTML templates
- **Interactive Status Page**: Tree-based roadmap with expandable details
- **Development Tools**: Test user deletion button for quick cleanup
- **Complete Dashboard**: Professional user dashboard with stats and verification banner
- **GitHub-Style Navigation**: Industry-standard user dropdown and smart routing
- **Authentication Flow**: Seamless registrationâ†’auto-loginâ†’dashboard experience
- Comprehensive test suite (all tests passing)
- Full CRUD API for job applications and user management

âœ… **Test Status**: All 4/4 main tests passing:
- Basic resume generation with LaTeX templates
- AI customization with job-specific optimization  
- PDF compilation with special character handling
- API endpoints for all functionality

## Project Structure

```
resume-automation/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/           # FastAPI app, routers, models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/          # Config, database, auth
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ generator/     # Resume generation, AI customization
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ worker/        # Background tasks (future)
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # Next.js UI (NEW)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/app/       # Pages (landing, auth, dashboard)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/components/ # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ test-scripts/      # Comprehensive test suites
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/context/      # Context preservation system
â””â”€â”€ resume_outputs/    # Generated PDFs and LaTeX files
```

## Quick Health Check

**First, please verify the system is working**:
```bash
python test-scripts/test_resume_generation.py
```
This should show "ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed!" with 4/4 tests passing.

## Context Files for Background

- **`docs/context/CURRENT_STATE.md`** - What's working right now
- **`docs/context/RECENT_CHANGES.md`** - Last changes made with context
- **`docs/context/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`** - Why certain design choices were made
- **`docs/context/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** - Common issues and solutions
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Technical documentation and patterns

## Current Development Status

**Last Session Focus**: Complete dashboard UI with GitHub-style navigation and professional UX patterns

**What's Ready for Next Steps**:
- All core backend functionality working
- AI integration with OpenAI and Anthropic working
- PDF generation with LaTeX working
- Complete authentication flow with email verification
- Interactive status dashboard with development tools
- **NEW**: Professional user dashboard with stats display
- **NEW**: GitHub-style navigation with user dropdown and logout
- **NEW**: Smart routing allowing homepage access for all users
- Comprehensive testing in place
- Clean, well-documented codebase

**Phase 1 Complete âœ…** - All 34 features implemented! 

**Phase 2 Priorities** (you can help decide):
1. **Go API Gateway**: High-performance gateway with rate limiting
2. **Worker Separation**: Dedicated agent processes
3. **Resume Builder Interface**: Interactive resume creation flow
4. **LinkedIn Scraper**: Automated job discovery
5. **Additional LLM Providers**: Expand beyond OpenAI/Anthropic
6. **Enhanced Templates**: More resume styles and formats
7. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, database tuning
8. **Deployment**: Docker containerization, CI/CD pipeline

## Key Technical Patterns

- **Multi-LLM Support**: Use `LLMService` for provider-agnostic AI calls
- **LaTeX Escaping**: Only escape user content (`|latex_escape`), not template structure
- **Authentication**: JWT with subscription tiers (free/pro/enterprise)
- **Database**: Async SQLAlchemy with user isolation via `user_id`
- **Testing**: Integration tests over unit tests for real-world validation

## Environment Requirements

The system needs these environment variables (check if configured):
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost/resume_automation
ASYNC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost/resume_automation
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# Email Configuration (optional - system works without it)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_FROM_NAME=ResumeAI Platform
```

## Getting Started Commands

```bash
# Verify system health
python test-scripts/test_resume_generation.py

# Check current status
cat docs/context/CURRENT_STATE.md

# See recent changes  
cat docs/context/RECENT_CHANGES.md

# View project documentation
cat CLAUDE.md

# Start services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Zookeeper)
docker-compose up -d postgres redis zookeeper kafka

# Run database migrations (note: current migration has issues, may need manual table creation)
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# Start API server (backend)
poetry run uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
# OR use the convenience script:
./start_api.sh

# Start frontend (from frontend/ directory)
cd frontend && npm run dev    # http://localhost:3080
```

## What I Need Help With

I'm looking for assistance with:
- [You can specify current focus area or ask what to prioritize]
- Continuing development on this well-established foundation
- Following the established patterns and architecture
- Maintaining the comprehensive testing approach

## Important Notes

1. **Database Migration Issue**: The Alembic migration file has reversed up/down functions. You may need to create tables manually if migrations fail.
2. **Authentication Flow**: Registration requires email verification. Test with `yodalives@gmail.com` and use the delete button on /status page for cleanup.
3. **Poetry Usage**: Always use Poetry for Python package management, not pip.
4. **SMTP Optional**: Email verification works without SMTP config - it will show tokens in console.

Please start by running the health check and let me know what you see, then we can decide on the best next development priority!
