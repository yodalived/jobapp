# Context Preservation System

This document explains the context preservation system implemented for seamless handoffs between different LLM sessions.

## Files Created

### üìã Documentation Files
- **`SESSION_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`** - Complete template for session handoffs
- **`CURRENT_STATE.md`** - Real-time system status and functionality overview
- **`RECENT_CHANGES.md`** - Last 10 significant changes with context and reasoning
- **`ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`** - Key design choices and their rationale
- **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** - Common issues, solutions, and recovery procedures

### üîß Helper Scripts
- **`generate-context.sh`** - Comprehensive context report with system health
- **`quick-context.sh`** - Fast context generation for immediate handoffs

### üìö Enhanced Documentation
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Updated with context preservation section and best practices

## Quick Start for New Sessions

### 1. Immediate Context Recovery
```bash
# Fast health check and context
./quick-context.sh

# Comprehensive system report
./generate-context.sh
```

### 2. Verify System Health
```bash
# Main functionality test
python test-scripts/test_resume_generation.py

# API endpoints test
python test-scripts/test_all_endpoints.py
```

### 3. Review Current State
```bash
# Check what's working
cat CURRENT_STATE.md

# See recent changes
cat RECENT_CHANGES.md

# Check for issues
cat TROUBLESHOOTING.md
```

## Session Handoff Workflow

### Before Ending Session
1. **Update Status**: Modify `CURRENT_STATE.md` with current progress
2. **Log Changes**: Add significant changes to `RECENT_CHANGES.md`
3. **Document Issues**: Add any problems to `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
4. **Test Everything**: Run `python test-scripts/test_resume_generation.py`
5. **Clean Git State**: Commit working changes

### Starting New Session
1. **Get Context**: Run `./quick-context.sh` for immediate overview
2. **Verify Health**: Run test suite to confirm system status
3. **Review Docs**: Check `CURRENT_STATE.md` and `RECENT_CHANGES.md`
4. **Use Template**: Copy context transfer template from quick-context output

## Context Transfer Template

```markdown
Hi! Continuing work on resume automation system.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Fully functional - all core features working
**Last Working**: [Insert current task with context]
**All Tests**: ‚úÖ 4/4 passing (Basic Gen, AI Custom, PDF compilation, API endpoints)
**Git Status**: [Clean/Has changes]
**Next Step**: [Insert specific next task with context]

Please run: `python test-scripts/test_resume_generation.py` to verify state.
```

## Context Files Overview

### `CURRENT_STATE.md`
- ‚úÖ What's currently working
- üöß What's in progress  
- ‚ùå Known issues
- Recent major fixes
- Environment requirements
- Next development priorities

### `RECENT_CHANGES.md`
- Last 10 significant changes
- Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Impact format
- Context and reasoning for each change
- Pattern analysis and learning

### `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
- Key design choices (multi-tenant, LaTeX, LLM integration)
- Options considered and why specific choices were made
- Trade-offs and future review points
- Decision templates for new choices

### `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Common issues and solutions
- Environment-specific problems
- Debug information collection
- Recovery procedures
- Prevention checklists

## Helper Script Usage

### `generate-context.sh`
Comprehensive system report including:
- System status (Python, Poetry, Docker, pdflatex)
- Git status and recent commits
- Service status (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Environment variables (masked)
- Test results for all test suites
- File structure verification
- Health summary with score

### `quick-context.sh`
Fast context for immediate handoffs:
- Current status from `CURRENT_STATE.md`
- Quick health check (main tests)
- Git status and recent activity
- Environment check (API keys)
- Service status
- Ready-to-copy context transfer template

## Best Practices

### Documentation Maintenance
- Update `CURRENT_STATE.md` when status changes
- Add significant changes to `RECENT_CHANGES.md` with context
- Document new issues in `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Record architectural decisions with reasoning

### Testing Strategy
- Always run full test suite before handoff
- Document test failures in current state
- Use test results as health indicators
- Maintain test coverage for new features

### Git Workflow
- Commit working state before ending sessions
- Use descriptive commit messages with context
- Keep clean working directory when possible
- Tag stable releases for rollback points

## Integration with Existing Workflow

This context preservation system integrates with:
- **Test Suite**: `test-scripts/` directory for health verification
- **Documentation**: Enhanced `CLAUDE.md` for technical details
- **Git Workflow**: Clean handoffs with committed state
- **Development**: Architecture decisions guide future work

## Success Metrics

A successful context handoff should enable:
- ‚úÖ New session understanding current state within 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ Immediate verification of system health
- ‚úÖ Clear understanding of what was last worked on
- ‚úÖ Knowledge of next priorities and blockers
- ‚úÖ Ability to continue work without context loss

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Automated context generation on git commit
- Integration with CI/CD for automatic health checks
- Dashboard for real-time system status
- Context versioning for rollback capability

**Quick Reference**: For immediate context, run `./quick-context.sh` and copy the generated handoff template.
