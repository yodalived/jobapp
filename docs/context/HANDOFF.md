# Handoff Document for Next LLM

**Date**: 2025-06-17 (Current Session)  
**Project**: Resume Automation Platform  
**Current State**: Phase 1 Complete (100%) ‚úÖ

## üéØ Project Overview

This is an enterprise-grade SaaS platform for AI-powered resume generation and job application tracking. The system uses an event-driven cell architecture designed to scale from 100 to 30,000+ users following a progressive scaling approach.

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + async PostgreSQL + Redis + Kafka
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui  
- **AI**: Multi-LLM support (OpenAI + Anthropic) with provider abstraction
- **Events**: Kafka-based event streaming with typed schemas
- **PDF**: LaTeX + Jinja2 templates for professional resumes

### Database Schema
- PostgreSQL with multi-tenant design (user_id isolation)
- Tables: users, job_applications, companies, resume_versions, notes
- Alembic migrations configured but had issues - tables created manually

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Information

### 1. Database Migration Issue
The Alembic migration file `7b0a910dc0b0_add_email_verification_token_field.py` was generated incorrectly - the upgrade/downgrade functions are reversed. The upgrade drops tables and downgrade creates them. Currently, the `users` table was created manually via SQL.

**To fix**: Either regenerate migrations or manually swap the upgrade/downgrade functions.

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Database URLs in `.env` must match the actual database name
- SMTP configuration is optional - system gracefully handles unconfigured state
- API keys for OpenAI/Anthropic are in `.env` (should be rotated for production)

### 3. Authentication Flow
- Registration creates unverified users with email verification tokens
- Email verification required before full access
- JWT tokens for authentication
- Test user `yodalives@gmail.com` can be deleted via status page button
- **NEW**: GitHub-style navigation with professional user dropdown
- **NEW**: Smart routing - homepage accessible to all users
- **NEW**: Complete dashboard UI with stats and verification banner

## üì¶ Recent Changes (Session Summary)

### 1. Documentation Alignment
- Updated all docs to reflect Phase 1 Complete status
- Synchronized README.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, and context docs

### 2. Enhanced Status Page
- Interactive tree-based roadmap with expandable sections
- Shows detailed implementation progress
- Development tools section with test user deletion

### 3. Authentication System
- Connected frontend forms to backend API
- Implemented email verification flow
- Added SMTP email service with HTML templates
- Password visibility toggle in forms

### 4. Test User Management
- Added `/api/v1/auth/delete-test-user` endpoint
- UI button on status page for quick cleanup
- Only allows deletion of `yodalives@gmail.com`

### 5. Complete Dashboard & Navigation (THIS SESSION)
- **Dashboard UI**: Full user dashboard with professional stats display
- **GitHub-Style Navigation**: Industry-standard user dropdown with logout
- **Smart Routing**: Homepage accessible to all, only auth pages redirect
- **Professional UX**: Stats in navigation bar, clean separation of concerns
- **Authentication Flow**: Seamless registration‚Üíauto-login‚Üídashboard flow
- **Logout Functionality**: Proper state clearing with full page reload

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ
**All Phase 1 features are now implemented!** The platform has:
- Complete user dashboard with professional stats
- Industry-standard navigation and authentication flows  
- GitHub-style UX patterns throughout

### Phase 2 Priorities
1. **Go API Gateway** - Replace Nginx proxy with high-performance gateway
2. **Worker Separation** - Move agents to separate worker processes
3. **Active Event Consumers** - Enable automated workflow processing
4. **Monitoring Stack** - Prometheus + Grafana for observability

## üîß Development Commands

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis kafka zookeeper

# Run API server
poetry run uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
# OR
./start_api.sh

# Run migrations (currently broken - see warning above)
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Run tests
poetry run pytest
```

## üìç Key Files & Locations

### Configuration
- `/src/core/config.py` - All settings via pydantic
- `.env` - Environment variables (use .env.example as template)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude AI assistant

### API Structure
- `/src/api/routers/` - All API endpoints
- `/src/api/models/` - SQLAlchemy models
- `/src/core/` - Core utilities (auth, email, database)

### Frontend Structure  
- `/frontend/src/app/` - Next.js app router pages
- `/frontend/src/components/` - Reusable React components
- `/frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - API client with TypeScript types

### Event System
- `/src/events/` - Event schemas and handlers
- `/src/agents/` - Agent implementations (Scraper, Analyzer, etc)
- `/src/workflows/` - Multi-step orchestration logic

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Database Migrations** - Alembic migrations need fixing (see critical info)
2. **Event Consumers** - Not actively processing events yet
3. **Test Coverage** - Integration tests exist but need expansion
4. **Frontend State** - No global state management (consider Zustand)

## üí° Architecture Decisions

1. **Event-Driven from Start** - Kafka integration enables future scaling
2. **Cell Architecture** - Single cell now, multi-cell ready
3. **Multi-LLM** - Provider abstraction prevents vendor lock-in
4. **TypeScript Everywhere** - Type safety across frontend/backend boundary
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Features added incrementally

## üìä Current Metrics

- **Total Features**: 34 (34 completed, 0 pending) ‚úÖ
- **Code Quality**: Clean, linted, well-documented
- **Test Coverage**: Basic integration tests in place
- **Performance**: Not yet optimized (Phase 2 priority)
- **UX Quality**: Professional SaaS-grade interface with GitHub-style patterns

## üîê Security Considerations

1. All endpoints require JWT authentication (except public routes)
2. Multi-tenant isolation via user_id foreign keys
3. Password hashing with bcrypt
4. CORS configured for local development
5. Secrets in `.env` (need proper secret management for production)

## üìù Final Notes

The project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation. The event-driven architecture is ready for horizontal scaling, and the code quality is high. The main focus should be completing the dashboard UI and then moving to Phase 2 infrastructure improvements.

The codebase follows consistent patterns and the documentation is comprehensive. The interactive status page at `/status` provides real-time visibility into system health and progress.

Good luck with the continued development!
