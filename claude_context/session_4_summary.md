# Session 4 Summary - API Consolidation and Testing

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Import Errors
- Resolved TIER_LIMITS import issue in auth.py
- Fixed UserCreate import (was looking in wrong module)
- Properly imported generator router in main.py

### 2. Consolidated Generator Modules
- Removed generator_v2.py duplicate
- Removed resume_customizer_v2.py duplicate
- Consolidated all functionality into single modules
- Maintained all advanced features (LLM, RAG, etc.)

### 3. Fixed API Endpoints
- Generator router now properly registered
- Fixed analyze-job endpoint to accept query parameters
- All endpoints returning correct status codes
- Proper error handling throughout

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Created test_all_endpoints.py covering entire API
- All endpoints tested and working
- Proper authentication flow verified
- Usage tracking confirmed working

## Key Issues Resolved

### Router Registration
The generator router was being mounted incorrectly:
Wrong: app.include_router(applications.router, prefix="/generator")
Fixed: app.include_router(generator.router, prefix="/generator")

### Import Errors
Fixed module imports in auth.py to correctly import from both modules:
from src.api.models.auth import User, TIER_LIMITS
from src.api.models.auth_schemas import UserCreate, UserResponse, Token

### Query Parameters
analyze-job endpoint expects query params, not JSON body:
Wrong: json={"job_description": "..."}
Fixed: params={"job_description": "..."}

## Current Working State
- All API endpoints functional
- Authentication and authorization working
- Job application CRUD complete
- User usage tracking operational
- Generator endpoints ready (need LLM API keys for full functionality)
- Health monitoring active

## Test Output Summary
- Health check - Database and Redis healthy
- Authentication - Login/register working
- User endpoints - Profile and usage stats working
- Applications - CRUD operations working
- Statistics - Summary stats working
- Generator - Endpoints accessible
- Job analysis - Working with query params
- Updates - Status changes and notes working

## Configuration Notes
- Using Poetry for dependency management
- FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy
- JWT authentication implemented
- Multi-tenant data isolation working
- Subscription tiers enforced
