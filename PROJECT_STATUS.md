# Resume Automation Project Status

## Project Overview
Building an automated resume generation and job application tracking system with learning capabilities.

## Current Phase: API Development (Day 1-2)
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Python environment with Poetry
- [x] Dependencies installed (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, etc.)
- [x] PostgreSQL and Redis running locally via Docker
- [x] Environment configuration (.env)
- [x] Basic config.py and database.py created
- [x] Database models created (JobApplication, Company, ResumeVersion, etc.)
- [x] Alembic migrations configured and initial migration run
- [x] Database tables successfully created
- [x] FastAPI application with startup checks
- [x] CRUD endpoints for job applications
- [x] Health check with service status
- [x] Auto-generated API documentation (/docs)
- [ ] Authentication (JWT)
- [ ] Resume template setup
- [ ] LinkedIn scraper
- [ ] Resume generator

## Working API Endpoints
- GET / - API info
- GET /health - Health check with service status
- GET /docs - Interactive API documentation
- POST /api/v1/applications/ - Create job application
- GET /api/v1/applications/ - List applications (with filtering)
- GET /api/v1/applications/stats/summary - Application statistics
- GET /api/v1/applications/{id} - Get specific application
- PATCH /api/v1/applications/{id} - Update application
- DELETE /api/v1/applications/{id} - Delete application
- POST /api/v1/applications/{id}/notes - Add note to application

## Key Technical Decisions
- Python-only (no Go hybrid)
- Async PostgreSQL with asyncpg
- Renamed 'metadata' to 'extra_data' (SQLAlchemy reserved word)
- Database connection check on startup with helpful errors
- Route ordering: specific routes before parameterized ones
- Health endpoint reports individual service status

## How to Run
# 1. Start services
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# 2. Run API
poetry run uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload

# 3. View docs
http://localhost:8000/docs

## Next Steps
1. Add JWT authentication
2. Create resume LaTeX templates
3. Build resume generator service
4. Start LinkedIn scraper

## Important Notes
- FastAPI auto-generates /docs from code
- Routes must be ordered: specific before generic
- All CRUD operations tested and working
- Database connection validated on startup

## Conversation History
- Chat 1 (2024-12-19): Initial setup, database models, migrations
- Chat 2 (2024-12-19): API endpoints, startup checks, route implementation
