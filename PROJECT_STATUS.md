# Resume Automation Project Status

## Project Overview
Building an automated resume generation and job application tracking system with learning capabilities.

## Current Phase: Database Setup Complete (Day 1)
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Python environment with Poetry
- [x] Dependencies installed (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, etc.)
- [x] PostgreSQL and Redis running locally via Docker
- [x] Environment configuration (.env)
- [x] Basic config.py and database.py created
- [x] Database models created (JobApplication, Company, ResumeVersion, etc.)
- [x] Alembic migrations configured and initial migration run
- [x] Database tables successfully created
- [ ] First API endpoints
- [ ] Basic authentication
- [ ] Resume template setup

## Architecture Decisions
- **Language**: Python-only implementation (decided against Go hybrid for faster development)
- **API**: FastAPI with async/await
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with asyncpg + psycopg2-binary (for migrations)
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis with Celery
- **Scraping**: Playwright (Selenium alternative)
- **Resume Generation**: LaTeX templates with Jinja2
- **LLM Integration**: LangChain + OpenAI
- **Deployment Target**: Kubernetes cluster

## System Components
1. **API Service** - FastAPI application for REST endpoints
2. **Worker Service** - Celery workers for background tasks
3. **Scraper Service** - Playwright-based job scraping
4. **Generator Service** - Resume/cover letter generation
5. **ML Service** - Learning from application outcomes

## Key Features Planned
- Job application tracking with state machine
- Automated resume customization based on job descriptions
- LinkedIn Easy Apply automation (Phase 1)
- Success pattern learning with RAG
- Auto-discovery of relevant jobs
- Analytics dashboard

## Infrastructure Context
Existing K8s cluster with:
- Redis
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL  
- InfluxDB
- n8n (workflow automation)
- Prometheus & Grafana

## Database Schema (COMPLETED)
- job_applications table - Main tracking with status, scores, timestamps
- application_status_history - Track status changes
- application_notes - User notes on applications
- companies table - Company information
- resume_versions - Track different resume versions and performance

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Create FastAPI main.py with basic configuration
2. Create CRUD operations for job applications
3. Add authentication endpoints (JWT)
4. Create first API router for applications
5. Test endpoints with Postman/curl

## Important Notes
- Changed all 'metadata' columns to 'extra_data' (metadata is reserved in SQLAlchemy)
- Using both asyncpg (for FastAPI) and psycopg2-binary (for Alembic)
- Database URL format: postgresql://user:pass@host/db

## Questions/Blockers
- None currently - database setup successful!

## Conversation History
- Chat 1 (2024-12-19): Architecture planning, tech stack decisions, project structure, database models, successful migration

## Commands Run So Far
```bash
# All previous commands plus:
poetry add psycopg2-binary  # Added for Alembic sync operations
poetry run alembic init alembic
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial models - job applications, companies, resumes"
poetry run alembic upgrade head
